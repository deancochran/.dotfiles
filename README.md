# The Big Idea
I want my configuration files to just work.

New Computer? Mac? Linux? **No problem.**


# Dependencies

One of the key pillars of my tooling is GNU's stow package. It creates a symlink to my home directory, and where ever my git files are located.


The step process for install should be simple...

- Clone the repo
- Create the symlink
- Run your configured services
